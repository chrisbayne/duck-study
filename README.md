## Project Description
A scientist is trying to understand how ducks are being fed in parks around the world. She wants to collect the following information:

- What time the ducks are fed
- What food the ducks are fed
- Where the ducks are fed
- How many ducks are fed
- How much food the ducks are fed

The scientist would like to crowdsource this information by creating a web application where
people can submit these data points. The scientist would like to be able to view all submissions
(please note that user management/authentication is not a requirement/expectation.)

Below you will find instructions on how to run the application from command line as well as my approach to the problem, technologies chosen,
and the amount of hours I spent working on the project.

## Learning objectives
- To design a Single page application to add, view, edit, and delete ficitonal data sets.

## Milestones

# Installation and Run Instructions

To begin running this application, first clone it by copying this line into your command line

<i>git clone https://github.com/chrisbayne/duck-study.git</i>

Once the project has been cloned to your machine, cd into the folder titled 'duckfood' and <b>npm install</b> the necessary node modules to run the application.

Next run <b>npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@4.6.0</b> to install React Bootstrap version 4.6

Next run <b>code .</b> to open up Visual Studio Code to view the code (if you use VSC)

Once those have both been installed successfully and the code is shown in your code editor, run <b>npm start</b> to view the application in your browser.
